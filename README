In the history of computer science there were few contests between algorithms like the ones in distributed computing. This project plans to make a comparison between some of the most important distributed algorithms in the history of peer-to-peer systems. We will approach these algorithms in a practical manner and show how they are implemented in a text editor environment where we will be able to demonstrate their full capacity not only for distributing the messages to all of their peers but to do so reliably.

The distribution algorithms for the replication of messages in the context of peer-to-peer applications are based on two message orders: Causal and Total. Most of this work stems from the initial insight of Lamport clocks, where the use of a counter is made such that the order of the messages is maintained. We implement the algorithms: Central Coordinator, Token Ring, Three Phase Commit, dOPT and Jupiter transform.
